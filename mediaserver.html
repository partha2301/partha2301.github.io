        <h3>
            Project Overview
        </h3>
        <p>
        I built a personal home media server using a Raspberry Pi 4, OpenMediaVault (OMV), Plex, and Kodi. The
        goal was to create an efficient, low-cost media solution that allows me to store, organize, and stream
        my entire media library across different devices on my network. This setup is perfect for on-demand
        streaming at home or remotely when I need it.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>
            What I used
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hardware</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Raspberry PI 4 Model 4 (4GB RAM)</li>
                <li>32GB Micro SD card for the Rapbian Operating System</li>
                <li>512GB External Hard Disk for media storage</li>
                <li>15W power subbply</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Software</li>
            <ul>

                <li>Raspberry PI OS Lite</li>
                <li>OpenMediaVault(OMV)</li>
                <li>Plex Media Server for managing and streaming media</li>
                <li>Kodi for local playback</li>
                <li>Docker and Portainer for contained service management</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>
            What I did
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Storage Configuration
            </li>
            <p>
                I formatted the external hard drive with ext4 and set up shared folders using OMV. This lets me
                access my media across all devices on my network, no matter where I am in the house.
            </p>
            <li>Media Streaming Setup</li>
            <p>
                I installed Plex on the Raspberry Pi using Docker, making it easier to update and manage. Plex
                automatically organizes my media files and makes them accessible for streaming on any device. I also
                set up secure user access for safe, remote streaming.
            </p>
            <li>
                Local Playback with Kodi
            </li>
            <p>
                For local media playback, I installed Kodi on the Raspberry Pi. I customized its interface with
                plugins and themes to enhance the viewing experience. Itâ€™s great for watching movies and shows
                directly from the Pi without needing an additional streaming device.
            </p>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>Skills I gained</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux System Administration</li>
            <p>
                I became more comfortable using the command line, managing file systems, and setting up services on
                a Debian-based OS.
            </p>
            <li>Networking
                <p>
                    I got hands-on experience with network configurations, including setting static IPs and managing
                    SMB/CIFS file sharing between devices.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Containerization
                <p>
                    I learned how to deploy and manage Docker containers, which made installing Plex and other
                    services more efficient. I also used Portainer for easy container management with a graphical
                    interface.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Media Management
                <p>
                    I learned how to manage media libraries, configure Plex for automatic scans, and set up Kodi to
                    seamlessly play media files from networked storage.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Result</h3>
        <p>
            The project was a success! I now have a fully functional media server that lets me stream and enjoy my
            movies and music from anywhere in my home. It's energy-efficient and modular, and I can easily scale it in
            the future by adding more services like Nextcloud or Pi-hole. It was a great learning experience that helped
            me improve my skills in Linux, networking, and containerization.
